    playArea:    >-
                 Generate waves on a string that stretches across the play area manually or with oscillators. 
                 Changing the way you generate waves changes the properties of the waves and the string in the control area. 
                 Decide how the end of the string should be attached to the end of the play area or allow it to extend into infinity.
    controlArea: Change the properties of the generated wave and of the string.

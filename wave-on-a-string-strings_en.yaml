  screenSummary:
    playArea:    >-
                 Generate waves on a string that stretches across the play area manually or with oscillators. 
                 Changing the way you generate waves changes the properties of the waves and the string in the control area. 
                 Decide how the end of the string should be attached to the end of the play area or allow it to extend into infinity.
    controlArea: Change the properties of the generated wave and of the string.
    currentDetails:
      start: |-
             { $isPlaying ->
               [false] The sim is paused while the
               *[true] The
             } wrench is near the { $wrenchPosition ->
               [bottom] bottom
               *[middle] middle
               [top] top
             } of the play area, and the string is flat.
      end:   |-
             The end of the string { $endPosition ->
               *[fixed] is fixed to a clamp.
               [loose] is attached to a ring that moves along a rod.
               [no] extends out to infinity through a window outside.
             }
    interactionHint: Move the wrench to make a wave or choose another way to start making waves.

  screenSummary:
    playArea:    >-
                 Explore different ways to generate waves on a string that tightly stretches across the play area. 
                 The string can be attached to a wrench to move manually or to oscillators that move continuously or pulse when you choose. 
                 Changing the way you make waves provides different properties of the waves and the string for you to tune in the control area. 
                 Explore the effect of changing how the end of the string attaches to the end of the play area or allow it to extend infinitely.
    controlArea: Change the properties of the oscillators and of the string.
